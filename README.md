# C Programming Lesson 7: String Functions

Welcome to Lesson 7 of our C programming tutorial series. In this lesson, we will dive into the world of string functions in C. Strings are essential data types in C used for working with text and character sequences. Understanding string functions is crucial for effective C programming. In this lesson, we will explore some commonly used string functions and how to use them in your programs.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with this lesson, make sure you have a basic understanding of C programming concepts, including variables, loops, and arrays. If you're new to C programming, consider reviewing the earlier lessons in this series.

## String Functions Covered

In this lesson, we will cover the following string functions:

1. `strlen()`: This function is used to find the length of a string
2. `strcpy()`: It is used to copy one string to another.
3. `strcat()`: This function concatenates (joins) two strings.
4. `strcmp()`: It compares two strings and returns an integer indicating whether they are equal, greater, or less than each other.
5. `strchr()`: This function searches for a character in a string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence.
6. `strstr()`: It searches for a substring in a string and returns a pointer to the first occurrence.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository contains example C programs demonstrating the usage of the string functions mentioned above. To get the most out of this lesson, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lesson-7.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Lesson 7 Directory**: Change your working directory to the lesson-7 directory:
   ```
   cd Lesson-7
   ```
3. **Explore the Examples**: Inside the examples directory, you will find sample C programs for each string function. Open and study these programs to understand how each function works.
4. Compile and Run: Use your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile the example programs. For instance:
   ```
   gcc strlen_example.c -o strlen_example
   ```
   Run the compiled programs to see the output.
   ```
   ./strlen_example
   ```
5. **Experiment**: Feel free to modify the example programs and experiment with different inputs to gain a deeper understanding of how these functions behave.
